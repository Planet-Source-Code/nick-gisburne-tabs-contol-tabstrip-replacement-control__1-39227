 Purpose:
 Replacement for much of the functionality of the
 standard TabStrip control
----------------------------------------------------------
 Limitations:
 I didn't set out to create an all-singing all-dancing
 tabs control. This is a simple control which displays
 tabs in a particular way, and is flexible enough for
 many purposes. If you want more, extend it yourself!
----------------------------------------------------------
 Using the TabStrip supplied by Microsoft, I soon realised
 I wasn't getting much value for the 1-Mb overhead needed
 by the common controls ActiveX.  I also wanted the look
 and feel you see here, which I couldn't find elsewhere.
 I looked at other replacements for TabStrip, but they
 used quite a lot of resources (images, text boxes, etc)
 which all put a drain on Windows. This control just uses
 a totally empty control and draws on it. It's as simple
 as I could make it.

 I also added a PropertyPage - I've not used them before
 but it was surprisingly straightforward. Very useful
 for administering the various tabs and their captions.

----------------------------------------------------------
 This control will be used in my commercial software, so
 if I think it's good enough I hope you do too! Enjoy!

Bio:

Self-employed sub-contractor, specialising in web design, VB coding, and back-end Internet 'stuff' (ASP, PHP, MySQL, Perl... you name it). Have also developed 2 applications marketed via gisburne.com - GisburneDB Database ActiveX (which provides simply but powerful database functions to languages which are otherwise not database-enabled, ie Toolbook and Director), and Karaoke Builder, a CD+G Karaoke production tool. One mad dog (Springer Spaniel), one English man, not much chance of the midday sun round these parts. Formula 1 crazy (brummmm!) and partial to heavy metal, long hair and and cult TV sci-fi. So not the stereotypical programmer then?!
