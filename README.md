### Description

Using the TabStrip supplied by Microsoft, I soon realised I wasn't getting much value for the 1-Mb overhead needed by the common controls ActiveX. I also wanted the look and feel you see here, which I couldn't find elsewhere. I looked at other replacements for TabStrip, but they used quite a lot of resources (images, text boxes, etc) which all put a drain on Windows. This control just uses a totally empty control and draws on it. It's as simple as I could make it.

I also added a PropertyPage - I've not used them before but it was surprisingly straightforward. Very useful for administering the various tabs and their captions.

I didn't set out to create an all-singing all-dancing tabs control. This is a simple control which displays tabs in a particular way, and is flexible enough for many purposes. If you want more, extend it yourself! Enjoy!
